# Hey reader, Bart here!

#### My name is Bartolom√© Ortiz, I'm a Ph.D. student of Computer Science at Granada University (Spain). My background is Applied Mathematics (BSc in Maths, MSc in Maths and Physics). 

#### I'm currently researching Recommender Systems for complex objects, specifically with applications in nutrition, diets, and microbiome. I work as a predoctoral researcher in a European Project (Stance4health). I'm an advocate of open science and open software.

#### In my free time, I love to talk about math, data science, computer science, skepticism and biology. I love to give talks about those things.  I'm the co-host of a science podcast: The Fluxions. I also love trail running, hiking and martial arts.
