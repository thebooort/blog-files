# The global map of math (not really, but it is close)

## Motivation

Lately I have been very obsessed with finding a way to create a concept map of modern mathematics. And it is not being easy. If we assumed that it was possible and that we had all the information, we would have a huge amount of information. The ramifications of mathematics are enormous and there are so many interconnected areas. It's a daunting task and I don't know if it's impossible. 

But whatever, the important thing is to have fun and learn along the way. 

I started to look for some attempts in this line. But I didn't like any of them. It is certain that there are really interesting schemes, but the structure towards impossible a visualization like the one that was looking for. 

## Finding MSC
I decided, considering the size of the project, that establishing all the connections would take time, but maybe a good place to start was to find a place where everything that needed to be related was. The goal was, therefore, to find an acceptable and used classification of the branches of mathematical knowledge that exist to date. 

And immediately afterwards I thought of Arxiv. I started looking for how to classify the articles, what structure it had, and that's when I got the first pleasant surprise: I found the MSC or the Mathematical Subject Classification.


## Tons of data


## The final (only for now) map of mathematics

You can find the final interactive map here (you can drag, click, zoom everywhere) [Mathematics Subject Classification 2020 edition](https://thebooort.github.io/cms2020-plots/plot/)
