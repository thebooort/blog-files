# OEIS Sequences Visualized

## Motivation
There is not much to tell here. If you don't know what the [OEIS](https://oeis.org/) is, there are hours of fun waiting for you. It is basically an online encyclopedia that collects almost all relevant integer sequences. You can find everything, but in particular many properties and curious numbers. 

Looking at some pictures of number visualizations I discovered one that assigned a color to each of the 10 digits and colored a grid according to the order of the digits of the chosen constant. I found it for $\pi$ but immediately I connected this visualization with the OEIS. I liked the idea of a visual identity card for the sequences of numbers and I jumped into it. 

In order to encourage a little bit the project (and test my script), I asked my followers in twitter to interact with a tweet and I would assign them a sequence and its photo. I have many interactions! 

A fun mini project.
